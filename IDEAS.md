# Ideas to improve Updater

## Changing the way it interfaces with json, such that you can specify what get updated when directly in the json.

I would like to change the structure of the json such that it also allows me
specify when to update per day, and also at some time maybe.


## Writing a version that could be used in conjunction with cron.

This will go hand in hand with the idea above, such that everytime this
program gets called it will begin to use the json with the time options in the
json file.
